# `app` Directory
The `app` directory contains foundational types and structures that define the core application context and its related components. These types serve as a central hub for managing configuration, database connections, logging, and other global application states.

## Contents
### `application.go`

This file defines key types and structures that encapsulate the application's shared resources and metadata.

## Purpose
The `app` package acts as the backbone of the project, providing centralized access to shared resources and configurations. It helps maintain a clean and modular codebase by encapsulating common functionality in reusable types.
